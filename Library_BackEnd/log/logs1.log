New progressive web apps have capabilities that will soon make you obsolete. With this hands-on guide, web developers and business execs will learn how—and why—to develop web apps that take advantage of features that have so far been exclusive to native apps. Features that include fast load times, push notifications, offline access, homescreen shortcuts, and an entirely app-like experience. By leveraging the latest browser APIs, progressive web apps combine all of the benefits of native apps, while avoiding their issues.

Control and Estimation of Piecewise Affine Systems presents several research findings relating to the control and estimation of PWA systems in one unified view. Chapters in this title discuss stability results of PWA systems, using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions and piecewise homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions. Explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllability and reachability of a class of PWA systems are considered along with controller and estimator design methods for PWA systems using linear matrix inequality (LMI) and bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) techniques. A PWA approach to a class of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system is discussed in depth. The book uses a number of mechanical systems, such as disk servo systems to illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods. Provides new insights on properties of PWA systems, including stability, stabilizability, reachability and controllability Presents a unified framework for analysis and synthesis of both continuous-time and discrete-time PWA systems Presents novel approaches for stability analysis and control design based on the promising SOS techniques, imageUrl=http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hwqjAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api, isbn=1782421629, rating=3, NoOfCopies=1

Good understanding of Javascript, HTML, and CSS is expected. What You Will Learn Create, reuse, and compose React components using JSX Share data between various React components and techniques for data flow within a React app Handle user interactions with the help of event handlers and dynamic components Set up and use various next generation ES2015/ES6 features with React Understand the performance and immutability features of React using React add-ons Learn the techniques of Animation in React Use data stores to store model-related data and information Create a flux-based React application by using Reflux library In Detail ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library that brings the power of reactive programming to web applications and sites. It aims to address the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications, and is intended to help developers build large, easily scalable and changing web apps. Starting with a project on Open Library API, you will be introduced to React and JSX before moving on to learning about the life cycle of a React component. In the second project, building a multi-step wizard form, you will learn about composite dynamic components and perform DOM actions. You will also learn about building a fast search engine by exploring server-side rendering in the third project on a search engine application. Next, you will build a simple frontpage for an e-commerce app in the fourth project by using data models and React add-ons. In the final project you will develop a complete social media tracker by using the flux way of defining React apps and know about the best practices and use cases with the help of ES6 and redux. By the end of this book, you will not only have a good understanding of ReactJS but will also have built your very own responsive frontend applications from scratch. Style and approach An easy-to-follow program to learn ReactJS with the help of real world projects. Each topic is explained within the context of a project and provides plenty of tips and tricks for using ReactJS., imageUrl=http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ht3JDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api, isbn=1785282743, rating=3, NoOfCopies=1

What You Will Learn Understand the role of the Angular router and how to make the most of it Build and parse complex URLs Learn about the componentless and empty-path routes Take control of states in your application Make use of imperative navigation Understand guards and how they can benefit your applications Optimize configuration and run tests on your routing In Detail Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL. In addition, you might want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand. Doing this transparently isn't easy. The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on demand. This book is a complete description of the Angular router written by its designer. It goes far beyond a how-to-get-started guide and talks about the library in depth. The mental model, design constraints, and the subtleties of the API-everything is covered. You'll learn in detail how to use the router in your own applications. Predominantly, you'll understand the inner workings of the router and how you can configure it to work with any edge cases you come across in your sites. Throughout the book, you'll see examples from real-world use in the MailApp application. You can view the full source of this application and see how the router code works to manage the state of the application and define what is visible on screen. Reading this book will give you deep insights into why the router works the way it does and will make you an Angular router expert.
